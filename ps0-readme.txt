- The academic misconduct example that would apply to Computing IV the 
most is (e) Engages in conduct aimed at making false representations of 
a studentâ€™s academic performance. Because the most common form of 
misconduct is saying that you wrote this paper, coded this program, or 
solved this problem even though you didn't. Students make a false 
representation of their academic performance.
